Chicken.gg Wager Tracker

This project tracks and displays the top wagers on Chicken.gg for a specific timeframe. The Python script uses Flask to host a simple web server and pull live wager data from the Chicken.gg API every 2 minutes. It updates a JSON cache, which is displayed on a webpage with a podium layout for the top three wagerers and standings for the top 11.

    Flask Server: Hosts a webpage showing live wager standings.
    API Integration: Fetches wager data from Chicken.ggâ€™s API, showing real-time rankings.
    Dynamic Standings: JavaScript dynamically updates the standings without needing a page refresh.
